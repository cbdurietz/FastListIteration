# FastListIteration

This test is based on two videos of Nick Chapsas:
- The fastest way to iterate a List in C# is NOT what you think (https://youtu.be/jUZ3VKFyB-A)
- Generating realistic fake data in .NET using Bogus (https://youtu.be/T9pwE1GAr_U)

It is meant to test the difference in performance between using a more generic IEnumerable<> and a List<> when iterating.
